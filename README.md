# MNIST-Fashion


Fashion MNIST :

● Fashion MNIST is a dataset found on Kaggle that serves as a direct replacement for MNIST. However, instead of handwritten digits, the classes are 10 items of clothing/apparel.

1.T-shirt/top
2.Sandal
3.Trouser 
4.Shirt
5.Pullover
6.Sneaker
7.Dress
8.Bag
9.Coat 
10.Ankle boot

● Just like MNIST, there are 60,0000 examples and each image is 28 x 28 grayscale.


Fashion MNIST Approach :

● We’re going to use the famous LeNet (made popular by it’s performance on MNIST) on our Fashion MNIST.

● This isn’t the world leader in MNIST, nor Fashion MNIST, but it is able to reach very high accuracy while being trained on CPU.
